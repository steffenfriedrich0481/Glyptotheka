# Specification Quality Checklist: Modern Tile-Based UI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

✅ **All validation checks passed** - Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

### Validation Summary:
- 6 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P3)
- 29 functional requirements organized by category
- 10 measurable success criteria
- 8 edge cases identified
- Comprehensive assumptions, dependencies, and scope boundaries documented
- No clarifications needed - specification is complete and unambiguous
